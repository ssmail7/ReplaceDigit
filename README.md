- For a detailed description of this project, please refer to Project 1.pdf

Version 2 (replace2.c):
- This version asks the user to enter a positive integer (the integer could be of any number of digits in the range of the integer type)
and replaces each digit by the sum of that digit plus 6 modulus 10. It also adds the use of replace and swap funtions that use pointer arithmetic,
not subscripting, to visit array elements.
